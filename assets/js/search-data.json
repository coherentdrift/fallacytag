    "content": "FallacyTag is a lightweight reasoning aid designed to surface flawed argument structure in online discourse—gently, interpretably, and without moralizing. Built around modern LLM capabilities and constrained design, it offers sentence-level feedback in the form of informal fallacy cues: not judgments, but structural prompts. This paper presents the concept, sketches its architecture, explores its feasibility across technical, social, and conceptual dimensions, and proposes a framework for deployment in varied modalities (text, audio, video). The core bet is simple: by making reasoning structure visible—even imperfectly—we can foster better reflection without requiring cultural revolutions or cognitive overhauls. FallacyTag isn’t a moderator or a fact-checker. It’s a nudge toward clarity, designed to fit where logic matters and tone is fragile. The paper is exploratory in form, rigorous in ambition, and deliberately uneven in tone. It is meant as a public proposal—for critique, adaptation, or reinvention. Next . ",

The core idea is technical: a lightweight, modular tool to highlight flawed reasoning in digital conversation. But the surrounding context is human. Tone, trust, and interpretation matter as much as model performance. So this paper moves between domains—language models, argument theory, pedagogy, and UX—and switches tone often. Some sections are nerdy. Others are more playful, skeptical, or intentionally jarring. If that feels uneven, it’s on purpose. Structural humility isn’t just a design constraint—it’s a writing constraint, too. This is for builders, educators, interface designers, and critics. You don’t have to agree.

Poet Andrew Choate holds up a mirror at an angle that flatters few: . Is it lazier to make a big thing, make a lot of things, or to make a small thing, not very much? There’s certainly an aura—perhaps even a suspicion—of laziness in prolificness. Choate’s insight is more than artistic musing—it touches something structural. In this framing, laziness isn’t about the amount of visible effort—how prolific or energetic someone appears—but about the effort that’s systematically avoided: the harder, slower work of cognitive depth—like tracking internal consistency across ideas, integrating perspectives, or wrestling with moral consequences. A person who constantly produces is not thinking hard enough. Reasoning is expensive biologically1: it draws heavily on focus, memory, and effortful synthesis. What’s avoided depends on the person and context—attention span, cognitive bandwidth, platform norms, and even educational background. People think just well enough to get by most of the time, which is to say, we don’t think well often. In the digital realm, the collective result of these savings is hard to miss even for a budget observer. The concept of productive laziness scales perfectly to the Internet, where prolificness dominates—across users who favor immediacy over depth, across platforms that amplify volume over structure, and across time as habits solidify into norms. We churn out tweets, comments, videos, and threads—creative, at times, but rarely cumulative. They seldom connect, challenge, or extend ideas in ways that build reasoning2. Entranced in sweaty pursuit of algorithmic incentives and social validation, we don’t resist the omission. Because reasoning is costly and platforms are optimized for metabolic thrift (privileging ease, speed, and volume), deeper forms of thought get displaced. Individual shortcuts are just that, but how the system responds to them invites scrutiny. The more we reward rapid, prolific contributions, the more those patterns dominate—and the more algorithms tune themselves to those patterns in turn. Poor reasoning isn’t just common; it’s reinforced. A positive feedback loop emerges: lazy thinking gets surfaced, incentivized, copied, and rewarded, until it becomes the baseline rhythm of public discourse. What’s avoided at scale becomes not just a personal lapse, but a structural erosion—a thinning of what holds thought together. Like a microphone too close to a speaker, the system begins to amplify its distortion. flowchart TD U[User Input: Quick, Shallow Content] P[Platform Incentives: Likes, Shares, Visibility] A[Algorithmic Prioritization: Surface &amp; Amplify] N[Norm Formation: Prolificness = Success] B[User Behavior Shifts: More Shortcut Thinking] U --&gt; P --&gt; A --&gt; N --&gt; B --&gt; U classDef loop fill:#fffbe6,stroke:#c9a100,stroke-width:2px; class U,P,A,N,B loop . Figure: The Reasoning Feedback Loop. And so, the Internet has grown vast and expressive—yet hollowed of connective logic3. This didn’t happen by decree—it emerged through a kind of ambient laziness: the positive feedback loop of systematic deferral of slow, effortful thought. 2.1. The Decline Question . We are taking a stroll among big ideas and dramatic questions, and here it’s paramount to walk past the wrong ones. I am reminded of a story that the legendary composer John Cage told in Indeterminacy: . After the concert I was walking along with the composer and he was telling me how the performances had not been quite up to snuff. So I said, “Well, I enjoyed the music, but I didn’t agree with that program note about there being too much pain in the world. He said, “What? Don’t you think there’s enough?” I said, “I think there’s just the right amount”. Cage’s provocation points out that saying “too much suffering” begs the question: relative to what ideal, what baseline, and by what mechanism are we measuring? This is precisely the kind of ambiguity that should give us pause before declaring reasoning in decline, whether due to platforms or anything else. Many critiques of modern discourse, from social media to political polarization, carry a background hum of nostalgia: the sense that people used to think better. But as a diagnostic, it’s deeply fraught. Measuring “reasoning” is hard enough. Comparing it across platforms, eras, and populations is harder still. What’s the unit of analysis? A syllogism? A thread? A voter base? A classroom? Should we weigh visibility, frequency, coherence, and influence? There’s no natural denominator—and no stable point of reference. Worse, the question may not even be consequential. Suppose we knew that the average quality of public reasoning had declined. What exactly would follow? Our task would still be to improve it. Or suppose reasoning had increased, but become less discoverable amid digital noise. That, too, would call for new tools and better infrastructure. We are looking to side-step the irony of dedicating the previous chapter to the sorry state of the online discourse, and avoid the descent into helpless lament. Rather than ask whether reasoning has declined, we prefer to ask: how can we support more of it, in more places, with less friction and more uptake? . We’re dissatisfied with the current reasoning environment, but we also see in it a challenge that lends itself, at least in part, to architectural solutions. 2.2 A Fork in the Feedback . The rise of large language models adds a new layer of complexity to the landscape we’ve just described. LLMs are trained on the same public discourse that platforms already distort—language shaped by speed, ambiguity, persuasion, and prolificness. So it’s reasonable to worry that they might amplify the positive feedback loop we’ve traced: reproducing shallow reasoning, reinforcing its patterns, and accelerating its spread4. But amplification is not an inevitability. While LLMs inherit the ambiguity and rhetorical shortcuts of human language, their behavior is shaped as much by architecture as by data. Prompt structures, interaction design, system incentives, and delivery context all influence what kind of reasoning they surface or suppress. In the wrong configuration, they amplify fallacies. But in the right one, they could help users notice what’s missing, slow down when it matters, and build with more structure. The challenge isn’t to perfect reasoning, but to scaffold it—to make its presence more visible, its absence harder to miss, and its structure easier to sustain. FallacyTag is one such attempt—but it’s not offered as proof of concept for the broader thesis. If it fails to change behavior or improve discourse, that outcome wouldn’t undermine the core claim: that reasoning can be shaped architecturally5. It might only mean this particular design—or this moment—wasn’t the right match. What matters is the direction of inquiry: building systems that make reasoning easier to see, to question, and to improve. If we can design for attention, we’d better design for reasoning. Previous Next . | Deliberate reasoning draws heavily on attention, memory, and executive control. Psychologists describe it as System 2 thinking—slow and effortful, unlike our fast, intuitive defaults (Stanovich &amp; West 2000; Kahneman 2011). Neuroscience shows it activates resource-intensive brain areas like the prefrontal cortex (Baddeley 2000), while cognitive load theory explains why unfamiliar reasoning tasks quickly overwhelm us (Sweller 1988). Evolutionary accounts argue that reasoning is selectively deployed—used when the stakes justify the energy cost, especially in social argument (Mercier &amp; Sperber, 2011; Lieder &amp; Griffiths 2020). Early studies have even tied sustained reasoning to glucose depletion (Gailliot et al. 2007) or, more recently, subjective fatigue (Kurzban et al. 2013). &#8617; . | Online discourse is often expressive or creative but rarely builds cumulative reasoning—a claim supported by multiple empirical studies. On Facebook, Del Vicario et al. (2016) showed that users interact primarily within ideological echo chambers, where emotionally resonant content spreads more effectively than deliberative argument. Singer et al. (2016) indicate diminished reasoning quality over time on Reddit, suggesting that platform interaction fails to reinforce sustained, cumulative reasoning. Aragón et al. (2017) note that drifting threads and ignored comments result from poor structuration of argument flow. Shortall et al. (2021) observe that digital platforms often degrade discussion quality when attempting to scale deliberation and highlight the scarcity of design features that support argument accumulation, critical thinking, and structured reasoning. Collectively, these studies suggest that while digital platforms facilitate creative participation, they seldom reward or reinforce the kind of reasoning that accumulates across exchanges. &#8617; . | We are aware of pockets of better reasoning on the Internet: longform forums, commentaries, Substacks, or collaborative writing spaces. The focus of this section is on what gets surfaced and rewarded at scale. The next section (2.1) explains that we are not interested in the authoritative grading of the Internet. &#8617; . | Large language models may amplify fallacious reasoning if not carefully constrained. Studies have found that while LLMs can identify certain fallacies, they often misclassify, overlook, or even generate flawed arguments, particularly in nuanced or ambiguous cases. For example, Teo et al. (2025) reported high variability in LLM fallacy classification performance, especially with intent-dependent types such as intentional or equivocation. Similarly, Manickavasagam &amp; Bandara (2025) noted that even with prompting and fine-tuning, models struggle with interpretive ambiguity. External evaluations have shown that LLMs frequently generate persuasive but fallacious content in argument tasks unless guided by structured reasoning constraints (Ji et al., 2023). &#8617; . | Several platforms exemplify how architectural design can scaffold cumulative reasoning online. Kialo structures debates via branching pro/con argument maps, which multiple (self-promoted but seemingly independent) educational studies and documentation show improve critical thinking, clarity, and engagement. Pol.is uses clustering algorithms to surface cross-cutting consensus, and its deployment in Taiwan’s vTaiwan platform has led to real policy outcomes (vTaiwan case study; The Computational Democracy Project case studies). LiquidFeedback supports structured proposition development, integrated deliberation and voting, and delegative democracy mechanisms used by the German Pirate Party (Kling et al., (2015)) and other civic groups (Behrens et al., 2014). These platforms illustrate that, with intentional architectural design, online reasoning can indeed accumulate meaningfully across exchanges. &#8617; . | . ",

Well, yes, if we use ranked choice methods of voting, which is what most countries in the world use to elect their leaders. And some methods are clearly better at aggregating the people’s preferences than others, the use of first past the post voting feels quite frankly ridiculous to me, given all of its flaws. But just because things aren’t perfect doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. Being interested in the world around us, caring about issues, and being politically engaged is important. It might be one of the few ways we can make a real difference in the world. Like Winston Churchill said, ‘Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other forms that have been tried.’ Democracy is not perfect, but it’s the best thing we’ve got.

The conclusion claims “democracy is mathematically impossible” based on the second meaning, while implying a broader political critique using the first. | . | Category Error | Arrow’s theorem demonstrates limits of preference aggregation mechanisms, not of democracy as a political institution. The conclusion incorrectly treats a limitation in one technical component as a flaw in the overall concept. | . | Appeal to Authority / Sentiment | The Churchill quote (“Democracy is the worst form…”) is invoked to justify staying engaged with democracy, but it bypasses logical argumentation. Churchill is not a mathematical authority, and his aphorism is used to close a technical argument emotionally, not analytically. | . | Non Sequitur | The conclusion jumps from “perfect preference aggregation is impossible” to “therefore, we should stay politically engaged.” This leap is not logically justified by the body of the argument, which focused narrowly on voting system mechanics, not civic virtue or political participation. | .

(comment text) . Case 1 . 💬 Comment . Would you say the difference between two different towns of the same size in your state is more or less significant than the difference between your town and the most similar Canadian analog? Because it seems to me that one town’s very like another when your head’s down over your pieces, brother whereas countries are much more strongly different from one another. Because national politics really varies much more sharply. In theory local politics could vary more sharply but in practice it doesn’t because towns and cities mostly just copy one another and if they do try to do crazy stuff people move away. 🤖 GPT Response . This passage contains several instances of flawed reasoning, particularly in terms of overgeneralization, false equivalence, and unsupported assumptions. Here’s a breakdown: . 1. Overgeneralization: . “Towns and cities mostly just copy one another…” . | This is an overgeneralization. While towns may adopt similar policies due to shared challenges, many diverge meaningfully in leadership, culture, and priorities. | . 2. False Dichotomy / False Equivalence: . “One town’s very like another… whereas countries are much more strongly different…” . | The comparison oversimplifies. Some Canadian towns may resemble American towns more than other American towns do. | . 3. Unsupported Causal Claim: . “…if they do try to do crazy stuff people move away.” . | People move for many reasons; the claim assumes too direct a relationship between local policy and migration. | . 4. Appeal to Subjective Experience: . “…when your head’s down over your pieces, brother…” . | Rhetorically colorful, but relies on personal sentiment rather than logic or data. | . Conclusion: The reasoning overstates national variation and downplays meaningful local differences through generalizations and untested assumptions. Case 2 . 💬 Comment . Local politics define if there’s some bollards or speed bumps on my street. National politics decide if I have healthcare, how much I pay for university and if I can buy a house someday or not. 🤖 GPT Response . 💡 . The statement draws a reasonable contrast but contains oversimplifications and false dichotomy. Key issues include: . 1. False Dichotomy / Oversimplification: . | It implies only federal politics matter for big issues. In fact: | Housing affordability is heavily influenced by local zoning. | University costs often depend on state funding. | Healthcare access is shaped by both federal and state policy. | . 2. Implied Value Judgment: . | It subtly dismisses local politics as trivial (“speed bumps”), ignoring important local functions like schooling, transit, and public safety. | . 3. Selective Framing: . | The examples cherry-pick federal power while ignoring where local control is dominant. | . Conclusion: While the federal government shapes many broad systems, the argument overstates its exclusivity and underrepresents local impact on life outcomes. Case 3 . 💬 Comment . No one’s ever been drafted by their state or county government. Federal taxes are much higher than local. Teaching to the test is exacerbated by W’s No Child Left Behind bill. Many local road projects are majority funded by federal funds, even more so for highways. Almost everyone will come to depend on Medicare and Social Security at some point in their lives. 🤖 GPT Response . The comment builds a case for federal dominance in influence, but relies on selective evidence, scope neglect, and equivocation. 1. Cherry-Picking: . | It highlights federal powers (e.g., draft, taxes, entitlements) while ignoring where state/local governments are deeply consequential (e.g., police, schools, housing). | . 2. Scope Neglect: . “Federal taxes are much higher…” . | Often true, but ignores that local taxes fund vital, visible services (schools, water, fire). | . 3. Oversimplification: . “Teaching to the test is exacerbated by No Child Left Behind…” . | True to an extent, but the law was interpreted and implemented differently by each state, and local schools determined how to meet test mandates. | . 4. Equivocation on ‘importance’: . | It conflates scale of policy with impact on daily life. For many, local decisions (e.g., crime, housing, school quality) are just as impactful as national ones. | . Conclusion: The argument rests on a one-sided portrayal of federal authority, minimizing the real power and variability of local governance. ",

Can large language models identify fallacies? Not reliably. However, we can set conditions that allow us to capture much of the potential value. We begin with an anecdote that showcases an LLM’s surprising moment of clarity (Section 3.0), and probe the conditions under which that clarity arises (3.1). From there, we sketch a design path that works within those limits rather than against them (3.2), and argue that the resulting interaction model may not only be sufficient, but also desirable (3.3). 3.0 A Glimpse of What’s Coming . Not long ago, I watched a well-intentioned, skillfully produced 23-minute YouTube video with my son. It explored Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem and the limitations of ranked voting systems. The analysis was methodical — until the final minute, when the tone subtly shifted from formal analysis to civic appeal. Suddenly, “democracy” was no longer a voting procedure but a cherished ideal. That Churchill quote appeared — never a good sign1. An emotionally satisfying, logically unmoored closing followed. My antenna twitched hard enough to unseat my trucker hat. Mildly bothered but unwilling to allocate much CPU to parenting, I brushed off the moment with a few glib remarks and let GPT-4 do the explaining. I asked the reportedly shaky logician to assess the reasoning in the video’s conclusion. Without coaching or fine-tuning, the bot accurately autocompleted some fallacies that are generally thorny to detect — such as equivocation, appeal to sentiment, and category error — far beyond what I expected. This wasn’t rote fallacy labeling. The model demonstrated contextual sensitivity — tracking meaning shifts, identifying rhetorical substitutions for logic, and anchoring its analysis in the argument’s actual structure. Teo et al. (2025) found that LLMs stumble on these flaws. They tested multiple LLMs on a structured fallacy classification task and found that performance was strongest for shallow, syntactically cued fallacies such as ad hominem or circular reasoning. Success rates dropped sharply when fallacies demanded contextual reasoning — tracking shifts, ambiguity, or intent. In those cases, even large models struggled to apply definitions or reason consistently across contexts. The pattern suggests that fallacy detection isn’t just a matter of fluency, but of structural grounding — something today’s models rarely do reliably unless the structure is already implicit in the input. And then it hit me: I had scaffolded the task. Not intentionally, I was just talking through what I wanted explained to my kid, but the result looked suspiciously like prompt engineering. Great. I’d become part of the model’s reasoning pipeline. The surprise wasn’t that the model flagged obvious errors — but that it caught reasoning drift you’d expect it to miss. The model identified those subtler flaws accurately, not because it understood, but because I shaped the task in a way that allowed it to navigate2. A fluent moment — but scaffolded. That’s what makes it interesting: it invites a reframing. Not “Can models detect fallacies?” — but “What if we designed systems around reasoning structure, not correctness?” . That’s the hinge: fallacy detection is brittle — brittle to tone, intent, ambiguity. But surfacing structure? That’s tractable. And if done well, transformative. 3.1 What Can Work Now: A Narrower but Useful Path . If the model needed me in the loop to think straight, at least one of us was in trouble. So I tried a simpler question: . Can a general-purpose LLM, with a plain prompt and no scaffolding, surface informal fallacies in a way that feels grounded and legible to a layperson? . Not reliably, not exhaustively — just, sometimes, usefully. I ran a comically small experiment to test it. I went to Reddit’s r/ChangeMyView, picked the first thread that wasn’t a political minefield, and pulled three consecutive recent comments. I fed them, one by one, into GPT-4 with a basic prompt: identify any flawed reasoning and explain why. No special formatting, no chain-of-thought nudges. The thread’s claim was typical: “Local politics is much more important to your life than national politics.” The replies were sincere but messy—ripe for overreach. | One cited Canadian municipalities to argue national politics mattered more. GPT flagged a false analogy and unsupported empirical claim. Fair. | Another drew a neat line: local = speed bumps, national = healthcare. GPT pointed to false equivalence and oversimplification. Again, fair. | A third listed federal programs to argue that national politics is more consequential. GPT noted cherry-picking and scope shifting—raising lifetime-scale policies to counter local day-to-day effects. | . This wasn’t exactly a rigorous evaluation — three comments, one researcher, zero inter-rater reliability. However, under plain conditions, the model provided structured and sensible feedback. This is where prior studies suggest models have the best chance of success — and where a product like FallacyTag might be viable. 3.2 Designing Within Limits . FallacyTag isn’t a truth judge. It flags form, not verdicts. Instead of asking whether a claim is right or wrong, it highlights how the reasoning is shaped—inviting reflection rather than imposing judgment. That shift in design intent makes all the difference. Structure-surfacing is tractable because it sidesteps the hardest parts of reasoning. Here’s how that tractability shifts depending on the type of reasoning and the structure of the input: . |   | Plain but Coherent Text | Disjoined Text | . | Surface-Level Fallacies | ✅ Reliable | ⚠️ Sometimes (depends on clarity) | . | Contextual Fallacies | ⚠️ Possible (with scaffolding) | ❌ Fails: too messy / brittle | . GPT-4 can help—but, by itself, it’s not enough of an answer. The earlier examples worked because the task was shaped to fit the model’s strengths: clear text, stable discourse, no ambiguity about roles. The model followed a structure I didn’t even realize I was providing. That’s not product behavior—it’s scaffolded response. Why doesn’t that generalize? Because the hard parts remain hard. LLMs still flounder with messy discourse, shifting tone, unstable goals. They don’t know when they’re helping—especially when reasoning becomes social, not just logical. A correct tag, surfaced at the wrong moment, can derail reflection. Reasoning isn’t just about logic. It’s about timing, tone, and trust. That’s not about accuracy. It’s about fit—the difference between a system that clarifies and one that corrodes. Prompts can’t patch that gap. Prior efforts have tried: instruction tuning, custom prompting, multi-turn clarification34. These work in ideal settings, with motivated users.567 They don’t scale to noisy, asynchronous discourse. FallacyTag takes a different tack: it accepts the limit and designs within it. No general truth judgments. No deep inferences. Just structural cues surfaced where the model’s fluency is stable—and offered only when useful. So the MVP has to respect both constraints: . | Model limits define what can be flagged. | Interface design defines how—and whether—it should be shown. | . That path is narrow but viable: sentence-level cues, tuned to form over content, optional and deferential. FallacyTag doesn’t try to be right—it tries to help. It surfaces the shape of reasoning: binary frames, abrupt pivots, unstable structure. Sometimes that shape hints at a fallacy; sometimes it just invites a second look. This isn’t correctness automation. It’s structural affordance. And that’s the bet: that even a soft, nonjudgmental tag — if offered at the right time, with the right tone — can open space for reflection. 3.3 Nudges as Pedagogical Design . Leo Tolstoy spent years trying to define art, writing a dense philosophical tome that sprawls across almost 200 pages—only to arrive at a surprisingly simple idea: art is the transmission of emotion from artist to audience. He could have said it in a few paragraphs. After reading this section, you may be able to relate to Tolstoy’s readers. The interaction model outlined in Section 3.2—where the system highlights reasoning that may warrant another look without outright calling it fallacious—is not just a fallback when the model is uncertain. It may be the best way to promote critical thinking, precisely because of how it distributes both cognitive and social responsibility. What we discovered on our trek through the Himalayas, driven by technical necessity, was always nearby, on level ground, with signs, if we looked through the lens of pedagogical virtue. From a learning science perspective, brief cognitive interruptions that demand user engagement are often more effective than immediate explanations. Theories of desirable difficulties8 show that introducing effortful, nontrivial steps—such as prompting a learner to retrieve or self-explain—can improve both retention and transfer. Rather than simply delivering the “correct” fallacy label, a nudge invites the user to reflect: Could something be wrong here? Why might this feel off? This preserves the productive discomfort that is central to metacognitive learning9, aligning with research that shows that prompting reflection improves the quality of argumentative writing more than providing corrective feedback alone10. Socially, nudges avoid the defensive posture often triggered by direct correction. In domains where argument intersects with identity—such as politics, culture, or values—overt labeling of fallacies can be perceived as dismissive or adversarial. Behavioral research on reactance11 suggests that people are more likely to resist information when it threatens autonomy. Soft interventions such as prompts or open-ended cues tend to preserve engagement, especially in mixed-audience or ideologically diverse environments. A system that says, “You may want to rethink this” invites participation; one that says, “You’re wrong” invites rejection. Figure: The surprising power of a soft touch. FallacyTag’s “nudge” design isn’t a fallback. It’s a convergence point: four fields of research point to the same principle—people think better when they’re invited to reflect, not told they’re wrong. This approach also scales better across uncertain or ambiguous cases. In many instances, what appears to be a fallacy may hinge on context, unstated assumptions, or interpretive nuance. Flagging such moments as “potentially problematic” rather than conclusively fallacious reflects appropriate epistemic humility. It helps the system avoid overclaiming and keeps the user informed, encouraging co-interpretation rather than authority-based override. Finally, this model has the potential to shift norms12. A system that reliably surfaces “moments worth pausing over” could, at scale, foster new habits of attentiveness. Rather than modeling omniscient critique, it models curiosity. And rather than framing fallacy detection as adversarial or corrective, it reframes it as an act of intellectual care: paying attention to structure not to win, but to gain a deeper understanding. In this way, what began as a workaround for model fallibility becomes a design stance toward better reasoning—both human and machine. Designing for fallacy detection under uncertainty might seem like a compromise. But as the shape of the solution emerges—from selective signaling to user-side engagement—it begins to look less like a concession and more like a blueprint for something better: a reasoning aid that doesn’t dictate truth, but invites rigor. One that foregrounds structure without overreach—a useful pattern not just for machines, but for people. Next, we’ll explore what it means to build from those boundaries.

In benchmark terms, this was a clean input — not a chaotic social media thread. The conditions were ideal for the model’s strengths. &#8617; . | Du, K., Xing, F., Mao, R., &amp; Cambria, E. (2024). The authors demonstrate that GPT-3.5 and PaLM-2 lack robust reasoning ability even in a structured domain like finance, particularly in tasks involving comparative and numerical reasoning. Performance improved significantly only when tasks were scaffolded with attribute-specific prompts—suggesting that without external structure, reasoning degrades even under domain constraints. &#8617; . | Lim, G., &amp; Perrault, S. (2024). While GPT-4 achieved high accuracy on a curated fallacy classification task, success required prompt tuning and failed to generalize to subtler or interpretive fallacies. The authors caution against over-interpreting such results as evidence of deep reasoning capacity, especially for real-world applications. &#8617; . | Manickavasagam, A., &amp; Bandara, D. (2025). Logical fallacy detection performance improves with zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting and task-specific fine-tuning; however, success is highly sensitive to the prompt format and context. Even with a tuned GPT-3.5 model, accuracy varied across fallacy types, with interpretive and intent-based categories remaining brittle. &#8617; . | Alhindi, T., Chakrabarty, T., Musi, E., &amp; Muresan, S. (2023). Their method uses multitask prompts and dataset-aware formatting to improve generalization across structured fallacy corpora. However, success still depends on having clean data and ideal conditions—fallacies are labeled ahead of time, prompts are structured, and ambiguity is minimized. &#8617; . | Schneider, J., Haag, S., &amp; Kruse, L. (2025). In a negotiation game with GPT-3.5, the authors demonstrate that users can “hack” the model through strategic misdirection, repetition, or invented flaws—highlighting not only reasoning vulnerabilities but also the inaccessibility of prompt engineering to most participants. The wide variance in outcomes exposes serious gaps in AI literacy and reliability. &#8617; . | Bjork, R. A., &amp; Bjork, E. L. (2011).

M., &amp; Kardash, C. M. (2005). In this study, students who were prompted to reflect or generate counterarguments produced more sophisticated arguments than those who received direct corrective feedback.
