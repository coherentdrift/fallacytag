    "content": "FallacyTag is a lightweight reasoning aid designed to surface flawed argument structure in online discourseâ€”gently, interpretably, and without moralizing. Built around modern LLM capabilities and constrained design, it offers sentence-level feedback in the form of informal fallacy cues: not judgments, but structural prompts. This paper presents the concept, sketches its architecture, explores its feasibility across technical, social, and conceptual dimensions, and proposes a framework for deployment in varied modalities (text, audio, video). The core bet is simple: by making reasoning structure visibleâ€”even imperfectlyâ€”we can foster better reflection without requiring cultural revolutions or cognitive overhauls. FallacyTag isnâ€™t a moderator or a fact-checker. Itâ€™s a nudge toward clarity, designed to fit where logic matters and tone is fragile. The paper is exploratory in form, rigorous in ambition, and deliberately uneven in tone. It is meant as a public proposalâ€”for critique, adaptation, or reinvention. ",

    "content": "This is a civic design essay. Itâ€™s not a pitch, white paper, or research submission. Itâ€™s an explorationâ€”part concept proposal, part system sketch, part cultural provocation. The core idea is technical: a lightweight, modular tool to highlight flawed reasoning in digital conversation. But the surrounding context is human. Tone, trust, and interpretation matter as much as model performance. So this paper moves between domainsâ€”language models, argument theory, pedagogy, and UXâ€”and switches tone often. Some sections are nerdy. Others are more playful, skeptical, or intentionally jarring. If that feels uneven, itâ€™s on purpose. Structural humility isnâ€™t just a design constraintâ€”itâ€™s a writing constraint, too. This is for builders, educators, interface designers, and critics. You donâ€™t have to agree. But if it makes you pause, test, or reframe, then itâ€™s doing its job. ",
