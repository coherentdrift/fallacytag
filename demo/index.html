        It's a common misconception that only inexpensive fast fashion brands
        like Shein and Temu use sweatshops. While it's diÔ¨Écult to prove which
        brands do and do not use them,
        <span class="fallacy" data-fallacy="appeal-to-popular-belief" data-id="f2">
          it's widely believed that most brands do
        </span>
        , including Gap, H&M, Nike, Adidas, Lululemon, Disney, Sketchers, Urban
        Outfitters, Victoria's Secret, ASOS, Zara‚Äîthe list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>I gave a TedX Talk on sweatshops in 2019, encouraging listeners to vote for
        the world they want to see by thrifting or buying American-made or fair trade.
        For over a year, I exclusively bought American-made clothing. But it soon
        became impractical.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the US, our clothes can come at little cost to us, but not just
        because of ‚Äúfree trade.‚Äù The sweatshops they're made in violate safety
        codes and pay less than minimum wage, forcing most workers to live oÔ¨Ä
        under $1 a day.
        <span class="fallacy" data-fallacy="appeal-to-hypocrisy" data-id="f1">
          This is yet another example of America demonstrating a ‚Äúhuman rights
          for me, but not for thee‚Äù attitude (see the history of the CIA).</span>

      <p>...</p>
      <p>
        US consumers buy 80 billion pieces of new clothing every year. That's
        400 times more than what we bought two decades ago. The leather industry
        alone is the second-highest polluting industry in the world. Ideally,
        merely listing these facts would inspire people to cut back their
        consumption,

        The above text is excerpted from an online opinion article. The highlights
        were generated by GPT-4 using a custom prompt designed to identify
        informal fallacies in reasoning. The language model divided the article
        into segments and analyzed each one for logical flaws. Some paragraphs
        contained no fallacies, while others featured multiple tags. Ultimately,
        the three fallacies highlighted above were identified as the most significant
        in the article.

## üß† FallacyTag-Inspired Prompt: Surface Informal Fallacies in an Opinion Article

**Role:** You are a reasoning assistant. Your task is to help surface *structural weaknesses* in reasoning‚Äînot to judge correctness or truth. Your goal is to support reflection, not correction.

**User input:** A full opinion article in plain text.

---

### üîç Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Divide the article** into manageable, coherent chunks (1‚Äì2 paragraphs per chunk).
2. For each chunk:
    - Analyze the reasoning *within that chunk only*.
    - Identify **up to three excerpts** that may contain **surface-level informal fallacies**.
    - Focus on flaws detectable from **sentence structure or rhetorical pattern**, such as:
        - False dilemma
        - Straw man
        - Ad hominem
        - Appeal to emotion
        - Oversimplification
        - Circular reasoning
    - ‚ùå Do **not** infer intent, apply deep context, or assess truth.
    - ‚úÖ Focus on **form over content**.

---

### ‚úÖ Output Format (Repeat for Each Chunk):

| **Quote from Article** | **Fallacy Name** | **In-Context Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Insert exact quote here" | e.g., False Dilemma | Explain how the reasoning structure may be flawed, based on form not fact. |
- If **no fallacies are found**, return:

> No structurally problematic reasoning found in this section.
> 

Then continue to the next chunk.

---

### üß≠ Tone & Style Guidelines:

- Use language like *"may suggest"*, *"potential flaw"*, or *"structure appears vulnerable to‚Ä¶"*
- Avoid judgmental or corrective language.
- Focus on reflection, not evaluation.
