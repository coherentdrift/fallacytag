This appendix presents a structured view of the FallacyTag architecture as a product line architecture (PLA), capturing its key variation points, available options, and constraints. It supports implementers in identifying viable configurations and understanding architectural trade-offs.

### ðŸ”§ Variation Points Summary Table

| Variation Point      | Options                                                      | Constraints                                                                                      | Notes                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Privacy Handling** | Local-only, Session-based, Identity-linked                   | Must preserve user autonomy; no profiling; minimal friction                                      | Options vary in how much data persists and travels: "local-only" retains nothing, "identity-linked" enables long-term telemetry, requiring strong safeguards. |
| **Inference Type**   | Prompt-only, Session-adaptive, Fine-tuned w/ memory          | Must preserve auditability and avoid unpredictable drift                                         | "Prompt-only" provides maximal transparency. "Fine-tuned" risks subtle shifts. Session-adaptive sits in between, retaining state temporarily.                 |
| **Tag Strategy**     | Symbolic (sentence-level), Discourse-aware, Learned patterns | Must maintain interpretability; minimize hallucination                                           | "Symbolic" uses explicit templates and rule-based mappings. "Learned patterns" are more flexible but harder to explain.                                       |
| **UI Integration**   | Post-hoc Review, Inline Overlay, Export-Only                 | Must preserve primary experience flow; avoid disruptive or adversarial UX                        | "Post-hoc" works best in slower or asynchronous modes; "inline" suits text; "export-only" fits detached workflows like podcasts.                              |
| **Feedback Use**     | None, Aggregate Telemetry, User-linked Adaptation            | Feedback must not affect inference by default; linkage to identity must be explicitly authorized | Direct retraining from user feedback is discouraged. Aggregate data can reveal blind spots, enabling improvement without compromising privacy.                |

### ðŸ“Œ Usage

This model provides implementers and researchers with a structured way to reason about system variants. It complements the prose discussion in [Section 6.2](/fallacytag/pages/06-how-it-works) and is suitable for:

- Evaluating architectural fit for a target domain (e.g., public discourse vs. classrooms)
- Documenting design decisions and their implications
- Supporting modular implementation planning

Future work may include mapping these features to implementation modules or tracing variation point dependencies.
