# FallacyTag

FallacyTag is a lightweight reasoning-feedback layer for flawed logic in the wild.  
It explores how flawed arguments might be surfaced and annotated—much like typos—to improve public reasoning without undermining dialogue.

## 📄 Read the Paper (Work in Progress)

Sections are being released incrementally at:

## 🎬 Live Demo

You can explore a live interactive demo here:

👉 [FallacyTag Demo](https://coherentdrift.github.io/fallacytag/demo/)

This demo highlights informal fallacies in a sample article. It was generated by prompting an LLM with a structured, pedagogical prompt (also viewable in the demo).
