FallacyTag is an experiment in offering **structure to public reasoning**.  
It explores how we might give flawed arguments the same visibility as typos—  
*not to shame*, but to support reflection, clarity, and better conversations.

This site hosts the live draft of the FallacyTag paper.  
Sections are being released incrementally. So far, the following are available:

- ✅ 0: Abstract  
- ✅ 1: Introduction  
- ✅ 2: The Societal Blind Spot: We See the Arguments, Not the Reasoning  
- ✅ 3: Scaffolded Intelligence: How LLMs Can Support Better Reasoning
- ✅ 4: The Proposal: What FallacyTag Might Be 🎬
- ✅ 5: Mediums, Modalities and Fit
- ✅ 6: How It Works
- ✅ 7: Is It Feasible?
- ✅ 8: Design Constraints and Ethical Edges
- ✅ 9: Conditional Case: When This Is Worth Building
- ⏳ Section 10: Coming soon  

Check the sidebar for what’s currently available, or follow the project on Substack for updates.

If you're a builder, educator, or curious skeptic—welcome.
