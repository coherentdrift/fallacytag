FallacyTag is an experiment in offering **structure to public reasoning**.  
It explores how we might give flawed arguments the same visibility as typos—  
*not to shame*, but to support reflection, clarity, and better conversations.

This site hosts the live draft of the FallacyTag paper.  
Sections are being released incrementally. So far, the following are available:

- ✅ 0: Abstract  
- ✅ 1: Introduction  
- ✅ 2: The Architecture of Avoidance  
- ✅ 3: Scaffolded Intelligence: How LLMs Can Support Better Reasoning
- ✅ 4: FallacyTag: A Gentle Loop for Sharper Thinking
- ⏳ Sections 5–10: Coming soon  

Check the sidebar for what’s currently available, or follow the project on Substack for updates.

If you're a builder, educator, or curious skeptic—welcome.
